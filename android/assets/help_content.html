The Human Language Compiler is a translator for human language based on
programming language technology. Therefore it is compact in size
and gives control on quality. It indicates confidence with colours:
<ul>
		<li><b>Green</b>:
                 semantic translation, should be correct.
                 But not necessarily the only correct one. 
                </li>
		<li><b>Yellow</b>:
                 syntactic translation, should be grammatically correct.
                 But can be very strange in its interpretation and choice of words.
                </li>
		<li><b>Light red</b>:
                 chunk translation, probably incorrect.
                 Builds the translation from small pieces.
                </li>
		<li><b>Dark red</b>:
                 word-by-word translation, almost certainly incorrect.
                 Builds the translation word by word.
                </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
You can translate both speech and text, as selected in the menu.
Translation works between all supported languages, which means 110
language pairs at the moment. But there are some caveats:
<ul>
  <li> The app works optimally <b>from English</b> and also from <b>Swedish</b>. 
  <li> From other languages it can be slow and give more red results.
  <li> The dictionaries can have errors, since they are partly extracted automatically.
  <li> Speech input from <b>Hindi</b> and output to <b>Bulgarian</b> don't work currently.
  <li> In <b>Chinese</b>, speech input is Mandarin but output is Cantonese (Yue).
</ul>
As we are constantly working on the app, expect frequent updates and improvements!
</p>

<p>
When you tap on a translation you get a screen with <b>alternative translations</b>.
Tapping on each of the alternatives
gives you <b>grammatical information</b>:
an inflection table, if it is a single word,
and a syntax tree otherwise.
</p>

<p>
The app also provides an <b>input method</b> which you can use as 
an alternative keyboard which allows you to do translation from
other applications, for instance while you are entering SMS or e-mail.
To activate it go to Settings > Language &amp; input.
</p>

<p>
The Human Languge Compiler works <b>completely off-line</b>, without
internet connection, although being on-line may give you better
speech input and output.
The app is small (around 23 MB for all languages).
We do not show ads.
