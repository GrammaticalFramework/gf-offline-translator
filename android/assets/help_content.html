Colours indicate confidence:
<ul>
		<li><b>Green</b>:
                 semantic translation, should be correct.
                 But not necessarily the only correct one. 
                </li>
		<li><b>Yellow</b>:
                 syntactic translation, should be grammatically correct.
                 But can be very strange in its interpretation and choice of words.
                </li>
		<li><b>Light red</b>:
                 chunk translation, probably incorrect.
                 Builds the translation from small pieces.
                </li>
		<li><b>Dark red</b>:
                 word-by-word translation, almost certainly incorrect.
                 Builds the translation word by word.
                </li>
</ul>
Translation works best <b>from English</b> and also from Swedish. From other languages it can be slow and give more red.
But expect frequent updates and improvements!
