DG Translator is a compact and completely off-line translator.
We do not show ads and we do not require internet connection.
However, if you encounter problems with the speech translation input
or output, it may work better if you are on-line. 
In all cases you can always use keyboard input, also for editing the
speech input.
</p>

<p>
We indicate the translation confidence with colours:
<ul>
		<li><b>Green</b>:
                 semantic translation, should be correct.
                 But not necessarily the only correct one. 
                </li>
		<li><b>Yellow</b>:
                 syntactic translation, should be grammatically correct.
                 But can be very strange in its interpretation and choice of words.
                </li>
		<li><b>Light red</b>:
                 chunk translation, probably incorrect.
                 Builds the translation from small pieces.
                </li>
		<li><b>Dark red</b>:
                 word-by-word translation, almost certainly incorrect.
                 Builds the translation word by word.
                </li>
</ul>
The translation works between any pair of the supported languages.
However, it works best <b>from English</b> and also from Swedish. 
From other languages it can be slow and give more red results.
But expect frequent updates and improvements!
</p>
<p>
When you tap on a translation you get a screen with <b>alternative translations</b>.
If the input is only a single word, then tapping on each of the alternatives
gives you <b>grammatical information</b> about the word.
</p>
<p>
The app also provides an <b>input method</b> which you can use as 
an alternative keyboard which allows you to do translation from
other applications, for instance while you are entering SMS or e-mail.
To activate it go to Settings > Language &amp; input.
