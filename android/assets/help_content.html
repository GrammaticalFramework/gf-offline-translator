The Language Compiler is a human language translator based on
programming language technology. Therefore it is compact in size
and gives control on quality, indicating confidence with colours:
<ul>
		<li><b>Green</b>:
                 semantic translation, should be correct.
                 But not necessarily the only correct one. 
                </li>
		<li><b>Yellow</b>:
                 syntactic translation, should be grammatically correct.
                 But can be very strange in its interpretation and choice of words.
                </li>
		<li><b>Light red</b>:
                 chunk translation, probably incorrect.
                 Builds the translation from small pieces.
                </li>
		<li><b>Dark red</b>:
                 word-by-word translation, almost certainly incorrect.
                 Builds the translation word by word.
                </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The Languge Compiler works completely off-line, without
internet connection, although being on-line may give you better
speech input and output.
The app is small (around 23 MB for all languages).
We do not show ads.
</p>

<p>
The Language Compiler translates both speech and text.
It works between any pair of the supported languages.
However, it works optimally <b>from English</b> and also from Swedish. 
From other languages it can be slow and give more red results.
But expect frequent updates and improvements!
</p>

<p>
When you tap on a translation you get a screen with <b>alternative translations</b>.
If the input is only a single word, then tapping on each of the alternatives
gives you <b>grammatical information</b> about the word.
</p>

<p>
The app also provides an <b>input method</b> which you can use as 
an alternative keyboard which allows you to do translation from
other applications, for instance while you are entering SMS or e-mail.
To activate it go to Settings > Language &amp; input.
