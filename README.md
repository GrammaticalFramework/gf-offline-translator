# gf-offline-translator
This is an offline translation app built on top of GF. It uses the RGL plus a big dictionary for translation. 

It is still using the old and noisy translation dictionaries from the wide-coverage repository but it should be updated to use 
the WordNet. The current state is a bit transitional.

The iOS implementation is lagging behind since no one is currently working on it.
